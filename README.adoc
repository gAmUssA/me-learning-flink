= Flink Learning Project

This repository contains examples and demonstrations of Apache Flink applications for stream processing.

== Overview

This project serves as a learning resource for Apache Flink, showcasing various stream processing patterns and techniques. It includes:

* Basic Flink examples (word count, row processing)
* Movie rating streaming application with Kafka integration
* Data generation utilities
* Docker-based deployment environment

----

== Technology Stack

* Apache Flink 1.19.1
* Java 17
* Apache Kafka (Confluent Platform 7.9.1) in KRaft mode (without Zookeeper)
* Gradle build system

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Java 17 or later
* Docker and Docker Compose
* Gradle

=== Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Start the Docker environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

3. Build the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----

=== Running Examples

==== Simple Examples

Run the WordCount example:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew run --args='io.confluent.developer.simple.WordCountJob'
----

==== Movie Streaming Application

The main application is a movie rating system that:

1. Generates movie data and ratings
2. Processes these streams with Flink operations
3. Calculates average ratings for movies
4. Joins movies with their ratings
5. Outputs the data to Kafka topics

Run the movie streaming application:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew run
----

Or with explicit class:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew run --args='io.confluent.developer.movies.MovieStreamingJob'
----

=== Kafka Topics

The application uses the following Kafka topics:

* `movies` - Raw movie data
* `ratings` - User ratings for movies
* `rated-movies` - Movies joined with their average ratings

== Examples Explained

=== WordCountJob

A classic example that counts word occurrences in a text stream:

* Splits sentences into words
* Counts occurrences of each word
* Demonstrates basic stream processing concepts

=== FlinkRowExample

Shows how to work with Flink's Row type:

* Creates a stream of Row objects
* Processes rows by adding new fields
* Demonstrates working with structured data

=== MovieStreamingJob

A more complex example that:

* Generates movie and rating data
* Processes streams with windowing operations
* Calculates average ratings
* Joins data streams
* Outputs to Kafka

== Development

=== Building

Build the application JAR:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew shadowJar
----

This creates an "uber-jar" with all dependencies included.

=== Flink Dashboard

Access the Flink dashboard at http://localhost:8082 when the Docker environment is running.
